# GenLayer Skill

GenLayer is a decentralized protocol where multiple LLMs reach consensus on complex tasks and decisions—the first AI-native blockchain. Use this skill when working on anything related to GenLayer, Rally, or the broader ecosystem.

## When to Use

- Explaining GenLayer to investors, developers, or partners
- Writing about the protocol, architecture, or vision
- Helping with Intelligent Contracts development
- Understanding consensus mechanics (Optimistic Democracy)
- Technical architecture questions
- Ecosystem/product discussions

## Quick Reference

**Tagline:** The intelligence layer of the Internet

**One-liner:**
> Bitcoin is trustless money. Ethereum is trustless apps. GenLayer is trustless decision-making.

**What it does:** Enables smart contracts (called "Intelligent Contracts") to natively access the Internet, process natural language, and make subjective decisions through AI-powered validator consensus.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Intelligent Contracts** | AI-powered smart contracts written in Python that can reason, access web data, and handle non-deterministic operations |
| **Optimistic Democracy** | Consensus mechanism using multiple LLMs + Condorcet Jury Theorem for trustless decision-making |
| **Equivalence Principle** | How validators agree on "equivalent" outputs despite non-deterministic AI results |
| **GenVM** | The execution environment for Intelligent Contracts |
| **GEN Token** | Native token for staking, gas, and governance |

## Elevator Pitches

**30 seconds (technical):**
GenLayer is a blockchain where validators run LLMs to reach consensus on complex, non-deterministic tasks. Smart contracts can access the web, understand natural language, and make subjective decisions—all validated by multiple AI models using game theory to converge on truth.

**30 seconds (business):**
GenLayer enables a new class of applications that need trustless AI decision-making: prediction markets on subjective events, AI-powered DAOs, automated dispute resolution, and performance-based contracts that verify real-world outcomes without human intervention.

**One sentence for crypto people:**
"It's like having a decentralized, incorruptible AI judge that can read the internet and understand context."

**One sentence for AI people:**
"It's infrastructure for AI agents to make binding agreements and resolve disputes without trusting any single model."
