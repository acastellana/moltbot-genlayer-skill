## Quick Summary

> **Bitcoin** is trustless money.
> **Ethereum** is trustless apps.
> **GenLayer** is trustless decision-making.

GenLayer is a decentralized protocol where multiple LLMs reach consensus on complex tasks and decisions. It enables smart contracts ("Intelligent Contracts") to:

- Process natural language
- Access real-time web data
- Make subjective decisions
- Handle non-deterministic operations

All validated by multiple AI models using game theory to converge on truth.

## Usage

This skill is designed for AI assistants (like Clawdbot) to load when working on GenLayer-related tasks. Load the relevant file based on your needs:

- **Explaining GenLayer** → `overview.md`, `thesis.md`
- **Technical questions** → `architecture.md`, `consensus.md`
- **Development help** → `intelligent-contracts.md`
- **Staking/economics** → `staking.md`
- **Use case ideas** → `use-cases.md`
